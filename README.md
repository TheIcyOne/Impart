# Impart
Impart your will on the world around you.


So basically, this adds an item which you can use to tear the soul from your body and use it to build and stuff.

Maybe it's a misuse of your immortal soul, but hey, it's immortal anyway, what does it care?

#Eye of Tethering
The Eye of Tethering can be crafted with an Eye of Ender in a furnace.
Holding the use key will cause a tether to fly out from you, and releasing will rip out your soul, transporting it to the tether.
You can then basically do whatever you want, as long as you stay close to the tether. Get too far and you'll be dragged back.
Pressing the use key again will snap you back to your body in an instant.
